# GlideKit

Clip. Render. Share your drives.

Desktop app for rendering [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) drive footage into shareable video clips. Paste a Comma Connect URL, pick a style, get an MP4.

Runs locally on your machine with GPU acceleration. No cloud, no Docker, no upload wait.

```bash
# Try it right now with a public demo route
git clone https://github.com/mhayden123/glidekit.git
cd glidekit
./install.sh    # one-time setup (~15 min)
./start.sh      # opens http://localhost:7860
```

## What You Get

**UI Overlay** — the full openpilot display with path prediction, lane lines, speed, and engagement state rendered over the road camera.

**Driver Debug** — driver monitoring camera with attention tracking, eye position, and head pose visualized in real time.

**Raw Camera** — forward, wide, or driver camera video transcoded to a clean MP4. No overlay, just the footage. Fastest render.

**360 Video** — spherical video from wide + driver cameras. Viewable in VLC, YouTube, or any 360 player.

All render types support file size targeting, HEVC output, and SSH download directly from your comma device.

## Install

### Linux

```bash
./install.sh
```

Installs everything: system packages, openpilot, GPU dependencies. Idempotent — safe to re-run. NVIDIA GPU recommended for NVENC encoding (CPU fallback works, just slower).

### Windows

Download the desktop app from [GlideKit Desktop Releases](https://github.com/mhayden123/glidekit-desktop/releases). It installs Python, Git, FFmpeg, and GlideKit automatically. Double-click and go.

For camera-only renders (forward, wide, driver, 360) everything works natively. For UI renders, the app walks you through a one-time WSL setup.

### macOS (beta)

Same as Linux. Requires Homebrew. VideoToolbox hardware acceleration. Headless UI rendering is experimental.

## Usage

### Web UI

```bash
./start.sh
```

Paste a Comma Connect URL, pick a render type, hit Clip. Output opens in your video player when done.

### CLI

```bash
uv run python clip.py forward --demo                    # quick test
uv run python clip.py ui "https://connect.comma.ai/..."  # full UI render
uv run python clip.py forward "<route>" \
  --download-source ssh --device-ip 192.168.1.x          # grab from device on LAN
uv run python clip.py ui "<route>" -m 0 --file-format hevc  # max quality HEVC
```

### Desktop App

[GlideKit Desktop](https://github.com/mhayden123/glidekit-desktop/releases) wraps the web UI in a native window. Manages the server for you — no terminal.
